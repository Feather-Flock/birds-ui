The [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) provided a project overview for students to follow, which can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/).


## Learning Goals
* Demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
* Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
* Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
* Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
* Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
* Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
* Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
