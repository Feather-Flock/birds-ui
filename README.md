## Project Overview
Welcome to Birds of a Feather! The goal of this app is to connect LGBTQ+ families through events in their area.

### Features
 - Users can search their area for events with other LGBTQ+ families using a visual map
 - Users can click on event cards or location icons to see more details about the event
 - Users can RSVP from the modal or view the host family's information
 - Users can make their own events from the new event page
 - Users can ensure they have the right address with the visual of the interactive maps
 - Users can delete their own events from their user profile
 - Users can edit their profile description
 - Users can add new tags to their profile detailing communities of the LGBTQ + they belong to
 - User can update their Denver zipcode and username

## Learning Goals
* Demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
* Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
* Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
* Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
* Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
* Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
* Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

Context API


## Project Reflections
#### Wins
* Getting interactive maps on both the dashboard and the event form
* Having users be able to look at the host family profile of different events

#### Challenges
* The event modal proved challenging for certain rendering capabilities (map)
* CircleCI sometimes had confusing errors and there is definitely still fuzziness surrounding it.


## Roadmap
Future features could include:
* Allow users to message each other about events
* Users get an email notification when they RSVP or when someone rsvps to their event
* Users can see who has rsvpd to their event and navigate to their profile
